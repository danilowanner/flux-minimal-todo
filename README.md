## About

Simple isomorphic react app, using flux architecture.

## How to use

Just `npm install` and `npm run build` when you're done. Use `npm start` to run the server.
Build and run with `npm run web`.

## Possible improvements

 * Use watchify to automate build process
 * Different way of transferring state (of stores) from server to browser?
